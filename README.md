  ## Description
  A text editor that functions as a web as well as individual application. Very versatile as the application model allows for offline use.

  ## Installation
  Clone the repository. Open up the terminal and input the command npm install, in order to install all necessary packages. Run "npm run build" to build the environment then run "npm start" to start the application.

  ## Usage
  When you open the application either through the heroku deployment link or through the downloaded repository it will send you to main page which is a simple text editor. You can type anything you would like into the input field. Any time you go to the next line it will always be numbered. All text will be saved and appear every time you open the application. You can also install the application by clicking the install button. You can also open the application in its own window by clicking the bounding box in the browser search bar.
